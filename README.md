The name `Nayuta` is in reference to [Nayuta](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Nayuta) (ナユタ), the reincarnation of the [Control Devil](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Control_Devil) who is raised as [Denji](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Denji)'s younger sister in the [Academy Saga](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Academy_Saga) of the ongoing manga series [Chainsaw Man](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Man_Wiki).

Nayuta also roughly translates to [a large number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_numerals#Large_numbers) denoting $10^{60}$ or $10^{72}$ in Japanese.
